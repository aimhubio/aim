"""
This system is designed to let users to check if the run had any progress.

While it may seem an easy task, it's very difficult to have a reliable way to
check if everything is fine with the process; The main (rank0) process may be
killed having no chance of notifying about failure. Even if the main process is
alive, the other moving parts may be stuck (network sync with other nodes,
filesystem, dataloader) those are not necessarily part of the main execution
thread. It leaves no other choice other than defining:

> The run is considered to be failed if it
> had not reported any progress in the promised time.

Thus, we can mark progress (we call these `check-in`s) and the expected time of
the next check-in. We can report a check-in after each forwarding each batch and
promising the next check-in to be reported in the next minute. If no check-ins
are received in the next minute, the run is most certainly failed or stuck (or
very unexpected things happened thus compromising the performance of the system).
This can have some exceptions: for instance, checkpointing the model and saving
the state into the filesystem may take a while. For such cases, aim integration
should check-in right before triggering checkpointing by promising much larger
time intervals.

Monitoring of run progress can be easily done by a service that periodically
polls the check-in instances. If the last check-in was there for longer than it
promised, the run is considered to  be failed thus triggering a (configurable)
failure notification.

Check-ins with zero `expect_next_in` values denote an absence of the expiration
date. In order to mark the run as successful, the last check-in should be
reported with a zero `expect_next_in` to indicate no further check-ins are
expected so the monitoring server will not treat stopped process as failed.

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

## FORMAT
The check-ins are implemented to be stored in the filesystem, in `.aim` repo
under the `check_ins` directory. Each file has no contents and encodes all the
information in the name.

The name format is as follows:
    `{run_hash}-{idx:08d}-{flag_name}-{absolute_time:011.2f}-{expect_next_in:05d}`
where `idx` is auto-incremented index per run, `flag_name` is the name of the
flag (usually `check-in`), `absolute_time` is the utc time of the check-in (is
intended only for debugging purposes), `expect_next_in` is the time in seconds
until the next check-in is expected.

## TIME
Note that we don't use last modified time to detect if the file is modified
because it's not that reliable especially for virtual and remote filesystems.
The utc time in the filename may vary across machines, and used only for the
debugging purposes.

## MONITORING SERVICE
The monitoring service supposed to periodically poll the directory and check for
the latest (lexicographically highest) check-ins per run.
If the last check-in was there (starting from the first time the monitoring
server had seen the file) for longer than it promised, the run is considered to
be failed thus triggering a (configurable) failure notification. A grace period is
introduced to avoid false positives.

## NON-BLOCKING INTERFACE

### `RunStatusReporter.report_progress()`:
By default, the check-in is non-blocking call in order to avoid any latency
introduced. This way, the caller can feel free to check-in as soon as possible,
even after each batch is forwarded or report the progress in vert small steps.

In order to avoid overloading the filesystem, not all the check-ins are stored
in the filesystem. Instead, if there is still time before the expiration, we can
wait thus avoiding unnecessary disk I/O. The filesystem writes are done only
when the time is (nearly) up. A separate thread is used to handle this process
which also cleans up of the obsolete check-ins having lower lexicographic order
than the current one.

### `RunStatusReporter.report_successful_finish()`:
Marking the run as successful is blocking call by default to ensure the check-in
is written to the filesystem before the run process exits. Note, that the
initialization of `RunStatusReporter` also does include blocking call to poll the
latest state in case of existing runs.

## INDIRECT INTERFACE
The preferred way of reporting check-ins is to call `.report_progress()` method on the
Run instance. However, in certain cases, the caller may want to check-in from a
code location that has no access to the Run instance (e.g. in dataloader, or in
the checkpoint callback). In such cases, the `.report_progress()` method can be called
indirectly by calling `RunStatusReporter.report_progress()` which will infer the run instance.

This is only possible if there is a single run instance in the process.


# TODO [mahnerak] Add Revision on:
  - [x] Multi-flag support, independent and global flushes
  - [x] Choosing stricter `expect_next_in` values
  - [ ] Legacy support for `progress` check-ins.
