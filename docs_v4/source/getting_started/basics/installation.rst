This section shows a simple end-to-end aim setup. It starts from the installation, shows how to run Aim UI and explore the
results.
Use this as a starting point to get familiar with the basics of Aim while getting up and running.

Installing Aim
==============

Aim is a python package available for Linux and MacOs for Python versions 3.6+. Install Aim using `pip3`:

.. code-block:: console

  pip3 install aim

Verify aim was properly installed

.. code-block:: console
  aim version

You should see the line listing newly installed version of Aim. For instance:

.. code-block:: none

  Aim v3.5.1

The installed package includes Python SDK needed for tracking training runs, UI for browsing the results and CLI
for managing UI and results.
